# DormWatch
Arduino project for Intro to Engineering to make a system that monitors lounge noise to detect high noise in quite hours.

SoundSensorTest.ino - file with sound sensor code 
TemperatureReading - includes file when sound sensor was not available. There is also some experimentation with graphing the incoming data in this folder.

Final Project code will be put in DormWatch.ino
